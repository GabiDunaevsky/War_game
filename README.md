# War_game
The purpose of the game is to prevent all the enemies
coming from the left side to reach the right side.
This is done by using the space button to shoot and the arrows to move
There are 8 levels you need to pass to win the game.
each level have his own limits (read more in \"Game levels\" button).
NOTE: If you collide with one of the enemies
it will bring the game to a state of total crush
which will lead to the disqualification of the level.
Each enemy can have number of lives depending on the level.
Therefore there will be enemies that will die only after several shots.

I did this project with an MVC design, there is a clear division of the view and the controller into different packages. Regarding the model, I attached to each level its own data (photos, music, etc.) that basically represents the model. In addition, I used additional techniques of design patterns, such as Factory design.
